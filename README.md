# Godot Mobile 2D Base Template

A mobile-first foundation for 2D Godot games. Copy it, rename it, delete the
examples you don't need, and start building your game instead of the plumbing.

- **Engine:** Godot 4.5+ (tested on 4.5 and 4.7.2), GDScript, fully typed
- **Renderer:** GL Compatibility (widest Android/iOS/Web device support)
- **Layout:** 720×1280 portrait, `canvas_items` stretch + `expand` aspect, notch-safe UI
- **Addon:** [godot_state_charts](addons/godot_state_charts) for entity and level state

Open `project.godot` and press **F5**: boot splash → main menu → level select →
five playable example games.

## What's inside

### Core services (autoloads, `Globals/`)

| Autoload | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `Types` | Enums, physics layers, groups, input actions, StateChart event names |
| `Global` | Stateless helpers: group queries, spawn root, geometry, `await Global.wait()` |
| `Events` | Typed global event bus (currency, levels, achievements, ads, app lifecycle…) |
| `Platform` | Mobile detection, notch safe area, haptics, app pause/resume, Android back button |
| `Settings` | Volumes, haptics, screen shake, battery saver, language — persisted in `user://settings.cfg` |
| `SaveManager` | Versioned, crash-safe JSON savegame with backup, debounced autosave, migrations |
| `Profile` | Player data modules: wallet, inventory, level stars, upgrades, stats, achievements, daily rewards, energy |
| `Audio` | Music cross-fades, pooled SFX, built-in synthesized UI sounds (no assets needed) |
| `Pools` | Object pooling for bullets, pickups, enemies, damage numbers |
| `Analytics` / `Ads` / `Store` | Provider-based facades with working mocks — plug in AdMob / Play Billing / StoreKit later |
| `UI` | Popup stack, confirm dialogs, toasts, loading overlay, automatic button feedback |
| `SceneManager` | Fade transitions, scene params, back stack, back-button routing |
| `Debug` | FPS/memory overlay + cheat panel (F3 or 5 taps top-left), stripped from release builds |

### Gameplay building blocks (`Scripts/Components/`)

Health, hurtbox/hitbox damage, projectiles (homing, pierce), velocity movement
with knockback, platformer movement (coyote time, jump buffer, double jump),
targeting (nearest/strongest/first-on-path), shooter (fire rate, spread,
multi-shot), pickups + magnet collector, loot tables, hit flash, health bars,
path following, wave spawner (markers / ring / path), stats with modifiers,
abilities with cooldowns, game camera (follow, shake, pinch-zoom, pan), tap areas.

### UI kit

Theme with button styles (primary / secondary / success / danger / icon),
safe-area container, currency & energy pills, stars, touch joystick, cooldown
button, HUD, and popups: confirm, settings, pause, results (with rewarded-ad
×2), reward, achievements, perk choice.

### Data-driven game definition

Everything a designer tunes lives in [`Ressources/game_config.tres`](Ressources/game_config.tres):
currencies, levels (with star thresholds and rewards), shop upgrades,
in-app products, achievements, 7-day login rewards, energy/lives, ad pacing.

### Example games (`Scenes/Examples/`) — one folder each, delete what you don't need

| Example | Shows |
|---|---|
| **Idle Tapper** | Clicker, persistent upgrades, passive + offline income, reward popup |
| **Arena Survivor** | Joystick, auto-fire, enemy waves, XP gems, level-up perks, active ability, meta-upgrades |
| **Tower Defense** | Path enemies, tap-to-build/upgrade towers, first-on-path targeting, lives & gold |
| **Match-3 Puzzle** | Grid matching, swipe + tap input, gravity/refill, cascades, moves & target score |
| **Endless Runner** | One-tap jumps, parallax, pooled obstacles, ramping speed, best score |

## Start a new game

1. Copy this repository and open it in Godot.
2. Set your name in **Project Settings → Application** and in `game_config.tres`.
3. Set the package / bundle id in **Project → Export** (`com.yourstudio.yourgame`).
4. New level: **Scene → New Inherited Scene** from `Scenes/Game/LevelBase/LevelBase.tscn`,
   attach a script that `extends LevelBase`, add a `LevelData` to `game_config.tres`.
5. Delete the example folders you don't need and remove their levels from the config.

## Testing

```bash
godot --headless --fixed-fps 60 res://Tests/SmokeTest.tscn
```

Boots every menu and level, exercises pause / win / lose / results, every
popup and the save round-trip (exit code 0 = pass; it resets the local save).
`Tests/ScreenshotTool.tscn` captures screenshots of any scene for layout checks
or store listings (usage in the script header).
