## Global event bus. Systems that don't know each other talk through these
## typed signals instead of holding references (e.g. a coin pickup emits
## currency_changed via Profile, and every CurrencyDisplay updates itself).
##
## Emit:    Events.score_changed.emit(new_score, delta)
## Listen:  Events.score_changed.connect(_on_score_changed)
##
## Dependencies: none
